        Ownership and remuneration are less important to players who come to
        games to play and buy stuff rather than develop and sell them. Another
        issue that directly impacts these gamers is that they spend real-world
        money to purchase stuff in-game, but have no method of recovering it.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        {`For example, if people quit playing a game, all the stuff they purchased becomes instantly useless. If the game is shut down for whatever reason, such as a drop in popularity that makes it less profitable, all the player's in-game purchases are lost forever. This is especially true when it comes to free-to-play (F2P) games. Purchases are one-way traffic. Players pay money to acquire items in the game but have no method of recovering their worth if they no longer use them and cannot lawfully sell them to another player, so they receive no recompense if the game is removed from the market.`}
